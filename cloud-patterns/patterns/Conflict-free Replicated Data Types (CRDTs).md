# Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) Pattern


## 1. Context

In distributed systems, particularly those that require high availability and partition tolerance, traditional methods of ensuring consistency like locking or two-phase commit are often too costly or prone to failure. CRDTs are especially useful in systems where low-latency or offline operation is required, such as distributed databases, collaborative editing platforms, and decentralized networks.


## 2. Problem

Ensuring consistency across multiple replicas of a data structure in a distributed system is challenging. Traditional consistency mechanisms like locking are not always feasible due to network latency, and they also introduce the possibility of deadlocks. Moreover, these mechanisms generally require strong coordination, which can be a bottleneck or point of failure. How can we enable multiple replicas to be updated independently while still converging to a consistent state?


## 3. Solution

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) offer a way to achieve strong eventual consistency without the need for locks or complex merge operations. CRDTs are designed in such a way that each replica can be updated independently and concurrently. The updates, when propagated to other replicas, are applied in a way that ensures convergence to a consistent state. CRDTs come in various types, such as counters, sets, and lists, each with their own rules for managing concurrent updates.


## 4. Benefits

- **Eventual Consistency**: Ensures that all replicas will eventually converge to the same, consistent state without the need for complex reconciliation.

- **Availability and Partition Tolerance**: Allows the system to remain available even when network partitions occur, adhering to the principles of the CAP theorem.

- **Simplicity and Scalability**: Reduces the complexity associated with locks, version vectors, or other coordination mechanisms, making it easier to scale the system.

- **Local Writes**: Enables low-latency updates by allowing each replica to process writes locally, improving user experience in geo-distributed systems.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **State Size**: Some CRDTs can have unbounded state size, particularly those that need to keep track of causality, like version vectors or operation IDs.

- **Communication Overhead**: As the system grows, the number of messages required to disseminate updates can become a bottleneck.

- **Complexity in Semantics**: While CRDTs simplify eventual consistency, they introduce their own set of complexities, especially when complex data types or operations are involved.

- **Lack of Strong Consistency**: For some use-cases, the eventual consistency provided by CRDTs may not be sufficient.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **[Operational Transformation](./Operational Transformation.md)**: Another approach to achieving eventual consistency but can be more complex to implement and maintain.

- **Two-Phase Commit and Locking Mechanisms**: These provide strong consistency but can be problematic in partition-prone or high-latency environments.

- **Quorum-Based Approaches**: These offer tunable consistency levels but require more complicated coordination and are sensitive to network conditions.
