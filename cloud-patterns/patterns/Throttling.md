# Throttling Pattern


## 1. Context

In distributed systems, particularly public-facing APIs, you may encounter a wide range of consumers with varying usage patterns. During peak loads or abuse scenarios, you'll want to ensure that the system remains available and responsive for all users.


## 2. Problem

How can you regulate access to a service or resource to ensure fair usage, especially during times of high demand or specific abuse scenarios?


## 3. Solution

The Throttling Pattern involves limiting the number of requests a consumer can make to a service within a given timeframe. This could be implemented at different layers, like the API gateway or the service itself, and could be based on different criteria, such as IP address, user ID, or token.


## 4. Benefits

- **Resource Fairness**: Ensures that no single consumer can overload the system.

- **Stability and Resilience**: Helps in preventing system failures due to resource exhaustion.

- **Predictable Performance**: Makes it easier to plan resource allocation based on limited usage.

- **Improved Availability**: Helps to keep the system responsive even under heavy load.

- **Abuse Mitigation**: Can help in identifying and mitigating abusive behavior or bugs in consumer code.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **User Experience**: Legitimate users may experience rate-limiting errors.

- **Implementation Complexity**: Implementing a sophisticated throttling mechanism can be non-trivial.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Priority Queuing**: Offering different levels of service to different types of users, possibly based on a subscription model.

- **Load Shedding**: Dropping lower-priority requests when the system is under high load.

- **Back-Pressure Mechanism**: Instead of rejecting extra requests, back-pressure involves slowing down the acceptance rate, dynamically adapting to the system load.
