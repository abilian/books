# Backends for Frontends Pattern

## 1. Context

In modern applications, different client types (e.g., mobile, web, IoT) often have varying requirements for data formats, payloads, and even security. Using a single, generalized API backend can introduce inefficiencies and complications.


## 2. Problem

How can you design a system that effectively caters to the diverse needs of different client types while maintaining efficiency and reducing complexity?


## 3. Solution

The Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern involves creating separate backend services tailored for each type of client interface. These specialized backends act as a gateway, aggregating and transforming data from various microservices into a form that is most convenient for their corresponding frontend.


## 4. Benefits

- **Optimized Performance**: Tailoring the backend to the frontend allows for more efficient data transfer and processing.

- **Simplified Clients**: Frontend applications can be simpler because they interact with a backend thatâ€™s customized to their needs.

- **Independent Scaling**: Each BFF can be scaled independently based on the load from its corresponding client type.

- **Optimized Client Experience**: Tailored APIs mean clients get exactly what they need and nothing they don't.

- **Isolation**: Changes in one BFF are less likely to impact other types of clients.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Code Duplication**: There's a risk of duplicating code across multiple BFFs if they share similar logic.

- **Increased Operational Complexity**: More backend services mean more components to manage, monitor, and deploy.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **GraphQL**: Enables clients to specify exactly what data they need, but this puts more burden on the client to manage data requests.

- **Versioned APIs**: Different API versions can be exposed for different clients, though this may not provide as tailored an experience as BFFs.

- **[API Gateway](./API Gateway.md)**: A single API gateway can serve multiple client types but may require complex configuration to serve diverse needs.
