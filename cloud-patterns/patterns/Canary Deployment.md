# Canary Deployment Pattern


## 1. Context

In cloud computing and distributed systems where there is a need to introduce new features, bug fixes, or configuration changes with minimal risk and quick rollback capabilities.


## 2. Problem

How can you introduce changes to a system in a controlled way that enables monitoring for any adverse effects before full-scale rollout?


## 3. Solution

The Canary Deployment Pattern involves rolling out the changes to a small subset of the system, often just a single server or a small percentage of users. This 'canary' subset experiences the changes before they are rolled out to the entire system, allowing you to monitor the effects and ensure there are no critical issues.


## 4. Benefits

- **Risk Mitigation**: Allows for testing in a production environment with minimal impact.

- **Quick Rollback**: If issues are found, changes only affect a small subset of the system, making rollback easier and quicker.

- **Performance Monitoring**: You can observe how changes perform under real-world conditions but at a smaller scale.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Partial Rollout**: New features will be visible only to a subset of users, which might cause inconsistencies.

- **Monitoring Overhead**: Requires extensive monitoring to catch any issues in the canary phase.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **[Blue-Green Deployment](./Blue-Green%20Deployment.md)**: Switch between two identical environments but might require more resources.

- **[Feature Toggle](./Feature%20Toggle.md)**: Toggle features on or off without deployments but can complicate application logic.
