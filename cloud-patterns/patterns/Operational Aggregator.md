# Operational Aggregator Pattern


## 1. Context

In complex cloud or distributed systems where operations span multiple services, databases, or other resources, and there's a need to aggregate operational data for monitoring, analytics, or troubleshooting.


## 2. Problem

How can you effectively collect, correlate, and visualize operational data from multiple services, databases, and resources in a way that helps you manage system health, diagnose issues, and optimize performance?


## 3. Solution

The Operational Aggregator Pattern involves consolidating operational data like logs, metrics, and traces from multiple sources into a centralized system. This aggregated data is then made available for querying, alerting, and visualization to provide a comprehensive view of the system's state and behavior.


## 4. Benefits

- **Unified View**: Aggregates data from various services to provide a unified operational view.

- **Improved Troubleshooting**: Centralized data simplifies the debugging and troubleshooting process.

- **Better Decision-Making**: Helps in making informed decisions based on comprehensive data.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Implementing a robust aggregation layer can be complex.

- **Potential Latency**: Aggregating data in real-time can introduce some latency.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Service Mesh**: Can collect and visualize some types of operational data, though often not as comprehensive.

- **Ad-Hoc Tools**: Using separate monitoring and logging solutions for different parts of the system, though this sacrifices the unified view.
