# Lease Pattern


## 1. Context

In distributed systems where multiple instances or nodes need to share access to a resource—be it a database record, a file, or some other entity—there's a risk of conflicting writes or operations. This risk is particularly pronounced in systems where network partitions, latency, or other forms of asynchrony can occur. The Lease Pattern is often employed in scenarios where exclusive, but temporary, access to a resource is required.


## 2. Problem

Multiple instances or nodes in a distributed system often need to write to or modify the same resource. Without proper coordination, conflicting writes can corrupt data or cause inconsistent system states. How can we ensure that only one instance has the right to modify a resource at any given time, while also accounting for the dynamic and sometimes unreliable nature of distributed systems?


## 3. Solution

Implement a leasing mechanism where an instance or node can acquire a lease for exclusive access to a resource for a specific duration. During this time, no other instance can acquire a lease for the same resource. Leases have a set expiration time to ensure that a resource is not locked indefinitely, especially if the instance that holds the lease fails or becomes partitioned. To prolong exclusive access, the lease must be renewed before it expires.


## 4. Benefits

- **[Data Consistency](./Data Consistency.md)**: Helps ensure that only one instance at a time can modify a resource, thereby preventing conflicting writes and ensuring data consistency.

- **Failover Support**: The leasing mechanism often incorporates automatic lease expiration, making it easier to implement failover procedures. If an instance holding a lease fails, the lease will expire, allowing another instance to acquire it.

- **Simplicity**: Often easier to implement and reason about than more complex distributed coordination mechanisms like consensus algorithms.

- **Resource Optimization**: By serializing access to a resource, the Lease Pattern can help optimize resource usage and performance.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Limited Throughput**: Because only one instance can hold a lease at a time, this pattern could limit the throughput for operations on the leased resource.

- **Lease Management Overhead**: Maintaining, renewing, and coordinating leases can add complexity and overhead to the system.

- **Risk of Starvation**: Poorly managed leasing mechanisms might lead to certain instances never acquiring a lease, particularly in high-contention scenarios.

- **Latency Sensitivity**: In high-latency environments, the time to acquire or renew a lease might become a bottleneck or source of failure.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Use versioning and conditional writes to detect conflicting operations, although this typically requires retry logic and doesn't prevent conflicts upfront.

- **Distributed Locking Services**: Use a separate service like ZooKeeper to manage locks, although this introduces another dependency and potential point of failure.

- **[Consensus Protocol](./Consensus Protocol.md)**: Use algorithms like Paxos or Raft to reach agreement across distributed nodes, although these are often more complex to implement.
