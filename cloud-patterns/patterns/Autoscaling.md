# Autoscaling Pattern


## 1. Context

In cloud computing and distributed systems, workloads can be highly variable, requiring flexible compute resources that can adapt to the changing demands.


## 2. Problem

How can you efficiently utilize resources in a cloud environment to handle variable loads without manual intervention?


## 3. Solution

The Autoscaling Pattern involves dynamically adjusting the number of server instances in real-time, based on the load. Autoscaling can happen vertically (scaling up or down individual instances) or horizontally (adding or removing instances). Monitoring metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and incoming traffic helps to trigger scaling actions.


## 4. Benefits

- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of resources based on actual needs.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay only for the compute capacity you actually use.

- **Improved Availability and Reliability**: Handles traffic spikes without manual intervention.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Implementing autoscaling rules can be complex and requires monitoring and adjustments.

- **Cold Starts**: Newly initiated instances might experience latency until they are fully operational.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Manual Scaling**: Admins manually add or remove instances based on forecasts, but this is less flexible.

- **Scheduled Scaling**: Scaling actions occur at predetermined times, but this method doesn't adapt to unexpected changes in load.
