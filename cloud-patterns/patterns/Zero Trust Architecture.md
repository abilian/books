# Zero Trust Architecture Pattern


## 1. Context

In traditional network security models, once a user or service is inside the network, they are often considered trusted by default. This approach leaves systems vulnerable to insider threats and lateral movement by attackers. In cloud and microservices architectures, the boundaries are often not as clear, amplifying these risks.


## 2. Problem

How can you ensure that every access request to resources, whether coming from inside or outside the network, is adequately verified to minimize the risk of unauthorized or harmful actions?


## 3. Solution

The Zero Trust Architecture Pattern involves removing the notion of trust based on network location. Every request for access to a resource is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted, regardless of where the request originates from. Technologies like multi-factor authentication (MFA), least privilege access, and real-time monitoring are often employed.


## 4. Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Reduced risk of insider threats and lateral movement by attackers.

- **Fine-Grained Control**: Ability to specify detailed access controls for individual users and services.

- **Adaptive**: Can adjust the level of scrutiny based on real-time risk assessments.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Increased Complexity**: Implementing a Zero Trust Architecture usually requires a plethora of components, such as identity providers, access proxies, and encryption mechanisms.

- **User Experience**: Multi-step authentication processes could affect user experience.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**: Create a secure tunnel for accessing internal resources, but still susceptible to the risks once inside the network.

- **Firewalls and Network Segmentation**: Traditional methods to secure the perimeter, but these lack the fine-grained control and real-time adaptability of Zero Trust.
