# Timeout Pattern


## 1. Context

In a distributed environment, operations may hang indefinitely due to network issues, server overloads, or other unpredictable factors. This can lead to resource exhaustion and cascading failures across the system.


## 2. Problem

How can you ensure that operations do not hang indefinitely, thereby avoiding resource exhaustion and improving system resilience?


## 3. Solution

The Timeout Pattern sets a maximum time limit for an operation to be completed. If the operation exceeds this time, it is aborted, and an exception is raised or a fallback mechanism is invoked. This ensures that resources are not indefinitely blocked.


## 4. Benefits

- **Resource Efficiency**: Helps avoid resource exhaustion by not letting operations hang indefinitely.

- **Enhanced Resilience**: Prevents one slow or hanging operation from causing a ripple effect of delays or failures across the system.

- **Predictability**: Makes the system behavior more predictable under failure conditions.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **False Positives**: If the timeout is too short, the operation may be aborted even when there's no real issue, leading to unnecessary retries or failures.

- **Complexity**: Needs to be fine-tuned for different types of operations and network conditions, adding complexity to the system.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **[Circuit Breaker](./Circuit Breaker.md)**: Can halt all calls to a particular service if it’s identified as a failing component, allowing it to recover.

- **[Bulkhead](./Bulkhead.md)**: Isolates failures but doesn’t provide the time-bound execution that a timeout ensures.
