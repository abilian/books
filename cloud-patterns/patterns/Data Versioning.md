# Data Versioning Pattern


## 1. Context

In distributed systems or cloud architectures where data is continually evolving and you need to keep track of changes over time, often for audit, rollback, or data analysis purposes.


## 2. Problem

How can you manage evolving data in a way that you can easily revert to previous versions, compare changes, or comply with data governance and auditing requirements?


## 3. Solution

The Data Versioning Pattern involves keeping multiple versions of each data item, typically along with metadata such as timestamps, version numbers, or the identity of the user who made the changes. This enables users to query data as of a specific point in time.


## 4. Benefits

- **Auditability**: Allows you to comply with governance and auditing requirements by having a trace of changes.

- **Flexibility**: Enables easy rollback in case of errors or system failures.

- **Data Analysis**: Ability to compare data over time and conduct time-based analyses.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Storage Costs**: Storing multiple versions of data can be storage-intensive.

- **Complex Queries**: Requires more complex query logic to access specific versions of data.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Log-based Systems**: Only store the changes (deltas) rather than complete versions.

- **Snapshots**: Store state at regular intervals, useful for less frequently changing data.
