# Materialized View Pattern


## 1. Context

In systems where query performance is crucial and you're dealing with complex joins, aggregations, or computations, the time it takes to generate a view dynamically can be unacceptable.


## 2. Problem

How can you speed up data retrieval times for complex queries in a system where read performance is a significant concern?


## 3. Solution

The Materialized View Pattern involves pre-computing and storing complex queries or computations as a "materialized view" in the database. These views are kept in sync with the underlying data, either through batch jobs or triggered updates.


## 4. Benefits

- **Fast Reads**: Query performance for complex queries is improved significantly.

- **Reduced Load**: Offloads the computational work from the main database or service.

- **Data Consolidation**: Can bring together data from multiple services or databases into a single view.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Stale Data**: There may be a lag in keeping the materialized view up-to-date.

- **Increased Storage**: Materialized views consume additional storage resources.

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Complexity in keeping views updated.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Caching Layers**: For less complex queries or temporary performance improvement, caching could suffice.

- **Database Indexing**: Proper indexing can speed up many types of queries but may not be sufficient for very complex scenarios.
