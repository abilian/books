# Branch by Abstraction Pattern


## 1. Context

This pattern is often used when an organization needs to make extensive changes to an existing codebase, such as refactoring, replacing libraries, or migrating to new platforms. It's particularly useful when the changes are too large to be carried out atomically but still require the system to be operational throughout the transition.


## 2. Problem

Making significant changes to a live system can be risky. Directly modifying existing code or adding new features may introduce bugs, degrade performance, or result in inconsistencies. Traditional feature-branching strategies can lead to long-lived branches that are difficult to merge back into the mainline, creating a "merge hell" scenario. How can we make extensive changes to a system in a way that is controlled, reversible, and allows the system to be operational during the transition?


## 3. Solution

Introduce an abstraction layer between the existing implementation and the new changes. This abstraction serves as a stable interface that delegates calls either to the old or the new implementation based on toggles or runtime configurations. The new implementation is developed behind this abstraction, allowing for incremental development and testing. Once the new implementation is ready and verified, the abstraction can be removed, or the system can be permanently switched to use the new implementation.


## 4. Benefits

- **Incremental Progress**: Allows the team to work incrementally on a new implementation while keeping the old one intact, facilitating parallel development efforts.

- **Risk Mitigation**: Errors in the new implementation are isolated by the abstraction layer and can be toggled off quickly, reducing the risk associated with the changes.

- **Clean Integration**: Eliminates the problem of long-lived feature branches and complex merges, making it easier to keep the codebase up to date and integrate changes cleanly.

- **Operational Continuity**: The system remains operational throughout the transition, enabling real-world testing and performance measurement of the new changes.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Added Complexity**: Introducing an abstraction layer and maintaining multiple implementations can add complexity to the codebase.

- **Performance Overhead**: The abstraction layer can introduce a minor performance penalty due to the extra level of indirection, although this is often negligible.

- **Coordination Required**: Requires good coordination between team members to manage the state of the abstraction layer and to decide when to switch or remove it.

- **Potential for Technical Debt**: If not properly managed, the abstraction layer can linger on and become a source of technical debt.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Feature Flags**: A simpler mechanism for toggling behavior but often not suited for deep architectural changes.

- **[Parallel Run](./Parallel%20Run.md)**: As discussed earlier, this involves running a new system parallel to the old one for validation but may not be feasible for all types of changes due to resource constraints.
