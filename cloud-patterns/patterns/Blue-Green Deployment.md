# Blue-Green Deployment Pattern


## 1. Context

In environments where continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are essential, and where minimizing downtime during updates is crucial.


## 2. Problem

How can you deploy new versions of a service without causing downtime or risking the introduction of bugs into the production environment?


## 3. Solution

The Blue-Green Deployment Pattern involves having two separate environments â€“ one "Blue" and one "Green." At any time, only one environment is live. New code is deployed to the inactive environment, which is then fully tested. Once ready, the traffic is switched to this environment, making it the new live environment, while the old environment becomes inactive.


## 4. Benefits

- **Zero Downtime**: The pattern allows for updates to be deployed to the system without affecting availability.

- **Quick Rollback**: If a problem is detected in the new version, traffic can be immediately redirected back to the old version.

- **Isolation**: New features can be thoroughly tested in a production-like environment before release.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Resource Intensive**: Maintaining two production environments can be expensive.

- **Complexity**: Managing and synchronizing two environments can be complicated.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Canary Deployments**: A small portion of the traffic is directed to the new version, gradually increasing it as confidence grows.

- **Rolling Updates**: Updating instances incrementally but can lead to a mix of versions running simultaneously for a period, complicating rollback.
