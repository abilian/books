# Circuit Breaker Pattern


## 1. Context

In a microservices environment, services often depend on other services. If one service becomes slow or fails, it can affect its dependents, causing resource exhaustion and further failures in a cascading manner.


## 2. Problem

When a service depends on another that is slow or unavailable, it may use up its resources waiting for a response. This could lead to the service itself becoming unavailable or slow, further impacting other dependent services and potentially leading to system-wide failures.


## 3. Solution

The Circuit Breaker pattern helps to prevent such failures by wrapping risky function calls (usually remote calls) in a "circuit breaker" object. This object monitors for failures and can "trip" or "open" the circuit when a threshold is reached. When the circuit is open, all calls to the service fail immediately without executing the function, thereby preventing resource exhaustion. After a predefined time, the circuit allows a limited number of test requests to pass through. If those requests succeed, the circuit closes, otherwise, it remains open.


## 4. Benefits

- **Resource Conservation**: Saves resources by failing fast when the dependent service is unavailable.

- **System Resilience**: Limits the cascading failure effect by isolating failing services.

- **Feedback Loop**: Provides valuable metrics and logs that can trigger alerts or be used for diagnostics.

- **User Experience**: By failing quickly and predictably, it’s possible to provide a more graceful degradation of service.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Adds complexity to the application in terms of both development and maintenance.

- **Resource Utilization**: In some cases, especially when not correctly tuned, a circuit breaker could trip too easily or too late, causing issues.

- **Data Freshness**: During the time the circuit is open, the application could be working with stale or cached data.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Timeouts and Retries**: While simpler to implement, these don't offer the same level of protection against cascading failures.

- **Bulkhead Isolation**: Separates services into isolated containers to ensure that failure in one does not bring down others. However, this doesn’t prevent failures but merely contains them.
