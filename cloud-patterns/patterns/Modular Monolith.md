# Modular Monolith Pattern


## 1. Context

Organizations with monolithic applications often encounter challenges related to scalability, maintainability, and technological agility. However, fully transitioning to a microservices architecture may be impractical due to various constraints such as existing investments in the monolith, complexity, or the operational overhead of managing microservices. In such cases, the Modular Monolith serves as an intermediate or alternative approach.


## 2. Problem

A traditional monolithic application grows increasingly difficult to manage and scale as features are added and the codebase expands. The tightly coupled nature of a monolith makes it challenging to adapt to new technologies or business requirements. How can the architecture be made more manageable and modular without transitioning entirely to microservices?


## 3. Solution

Organize the monolithic application into well-defined, loosely coupled modules, each responsible for a distinct feature or business capability. Each module should have its own separate codebase, dependencies, and database schema, similar to how a microservice would be designed. However, these modules are not separate processes; they run in the same application process but are isolated from each other to a large extent. Communication between modules is generally through well-defined APIs or interfaces within the same codebase.


## 4. Benefits

- **Simpler Migration Path**: Offers an easier path for organizations that want to later move to a full microservices architecture, as modules can be broken out into independent services when necessary.

- **Reduced Complexity**: Unlike a full microservices architecture, there’s no need to deal with inter-process communication, data synchronization, or other complexities of a distributed system.

- **Improved Maintainability**: Modules can be developed, tested, and deployed independently within the monolith, improving manageability.

- **Technological Flexibility**: Each module can potentially use different technologies, as long as they can co-exist within the same runtime environment.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Limited Scalability**: While more modular than a traditional monolith, the Modular Monolith is still a single application and thus has limitations on how far it can be scaled.

- **Resource Sharing**: Running in a single process means all modules share system resources, which can become a bottleneck.

- **Partial Independence**: Even with well-defined boundaries, modules are part of the same application, leading to potential coupling that could make future decomposition challenging.

- **Operational Uniformity**: Unlike microservices, where each service can be operated with different scaling, resilience, and operational policies, a Modular Monolith would generally have a uniform operational profile.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Microservices Architecture**: If the challenges and costs of managing a distributed system are acceptable, a full transition to microservices could offer greater benefits in scalability and technological agility.

- **Layered Architecture**: Continue with a monolithic architecture but impose strict layering rules to separate concerns, though this doesn’t offer as much modularity or independence as a Modular Monolith.
