# Data Encryption Pattern


## 1. Context

As data moves between various services and databases in a cloud environment, it becomes susceptible to unauthorized access and tampering. Similarly, at-rest data in databases is also a target for attacks.


## 2. Problem

How do you secure the confidentiality and integrity of data as it traverses over the network and resides in storage, while complying with regulatory standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS?


## 3. Solution

The Data Encryption Pattern involves encrypting data at rest, in transit, and sometimes even in use. The pattern employs strong encryption algorithms and key management strategies to ensure the data is securely encrypted and decrypted only by authorized services.


## 4. Benefits

- **Confidentiality**: Unauthorized parties cannot easily read or modify encrypted data.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps in complying with legal and regulatory requirements for data protection.

- **Integrity**: Encryption algorithms can be paired with message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure that data has not been tampered with.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Performance Overhead**: Encryption and decryption processes can introduce latency and consume more computational resources.

- **Key Management Complexity**: Securely managing encryption keys is non-trivial and requires an additional layer of management.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Tokenization**: Replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholders. Useful for specific use-cases but not as broadly applicable as encryption.

- **Access Control**: Relying solely on strong access controls to protect data, although this method doesn't offer the same level of protection as encryption.
