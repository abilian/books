# Outbox Pattern


## 1. Context

In microservices architectures, services often need to publish events to notify other services of changes in their state. However, ensuring that the state change and the event publishing are both successfully executed can be challenging, especially in distributed systems.


## 2. Problem

How can you reliably publish events as part of a state-changing operation, ensuring that either both occur or neither do, particularly in a distributed environment?


## 3. Solution

The Outbox Pattern involves using a database table as an "outbox" to store events as part of the same local transaction that updates the serviceâ€™s own database. A separate message relay process then reads the events from the outbox and publishes them.


## 4. Benefits

- **Transactional Integrity**: Ensures that the database state and the published events are consistent.

- **Decoupling**: The service is not tightly coupled to the message broker or other target services.

- **Reliability**: Even if the message relay process fails, the events are not lost; they remain in the outbox.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Latency**: There's an added delay due to the asynchronous nature of the message relay process.

- **Complexity**: Adds complexity in terms of additional tables and processes.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Two-Phase Commit**: Ensures atomicity across multiple services, but introduces complexity and potential for distributed locks.

- **[Event Sourcing](./Event Sourcing.md)**: Achieves a similar outcome by storing state changes as events, though this might require a larger overhaul of the application logic.
