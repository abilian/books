# Rate Limiter Pattern

The "Rate Limiter" pattern is instrumental in maintaining the quality of service in various types of distributed systems, including cloud computing and microservices.


## 1. Context

Rate limiting is crucial when you have varying levels of service consumption across clients, or when your services are exposed to external consumers. Unregulated access can lead to resource exhaustion, thereby affecting the system's availability.


## 2. Problem

How can a system ensure fair usage of resources and prevent any single consumer or set of consumers from overloading the service? Unrestricted access can lead to service degradation, increased latency, or even outages.


## 3. Solution

Implement a Rate Limiter that controls the amount of incoming requests a service can handle within a given time window. This can be done based on different criteria such as IP address, API token, or user account. The rate-limiting logic can reside within the service itself, or it can be externalized into a separate component.


## 4. Benefits

- **Fair Usage**: Ensures that no single client can overwhelm the service, thereby ensuring equitable resource distribution.

- **Resource Optimization**: Helps in optimal utilization of system resources.

- **Quality of Service**: Helps in maintaining a consistent service quality even under high load.

- **Cost Management**: Can help in controlling operational costs by preventing resource exhaustion.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Needs careful tuning and monitoring to balance between usability and resource optimization.

- **Latency**: Introduces additional processing time to check the rate limit criteria.

- **False Positives**: Overzealous rate limiting can block or degrade service for legitimate users.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Priority Queueing**: This doesn't limit the rate but can prioritize resource access based on some criteria.

- **Quotas**: Another form of limiting usage but usually over longer periods, which may not prevent short bursts of high usage.
