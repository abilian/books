# Health Check API Pattern


## 1. Context

In microservices or distributed architectures, understanding the state of various services is crucial for both system monitoring and resilience. It's vital to know quickly if any service is in a failed state to prevent cascading failures or to replace it.


## 2. Problem

How can you monitor the health of individual services within a distributed system effectively, enabling quick diagnostics and interventions?


## 3. Solution

The Health Check API Pattern involves implementing a health check interface (usually an HTTP API endpoint) in each service. This interface returns the status of the service, including various metrics or checks like database connectivity, available resources, or any other custom checks relevant to the service. Monitoring tools or orchestrators can periodically check these endpoints.


## 4. Benefits

- **Quick Diagnostics**: Enables rapid identification of unhealthy services, facilitating quicker interventions.

- **Improved Resilience**: Health checks can be integrated with service orchestration tools to automatically replace or restart unhealthy instances.

- **Simplicity**: Typically straightforward to implement and integrate into existing services.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **False Alarms**: Poorly designed health checks can trigger false alarms, causing unnecessary escalations.

- **Resource Utilization**: Frequent health checks can add extra load to the system, especially if the checks are complex.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Logging and Monitoring**: These can provide similar diagnostics but usually are not as real-time as health checks for detecting issues.

- **[Rate Limiter](./Rate Limiter.md) and [Circuit Breaker](./Circuit Breaker.md)**: These can protect against failure cascades but don't provide direct health information about services.
