# Valet Key Pattern


## 1. Context

In cloud computing and distributed systems where secure, time-limited access to certain resources is required, typically for large objects like files or blobs in storage services.


## 2. Problem

How can you provide a secure yet convenient way for clients to access specific resources directly without exposing the underlying authentication and authorization mechanisms?


## 3. Solution

The Valet Key Pattern involves generating a time-limited token with specific permissions that is handed to a client. This token allows the client to access a specific resource directly, bypassing the need for the client to interact with an authorization layer for each request.


## 4. Benefits

- **Reduced Load on Services**: Offloads the authentication and authorization process from your application or service.

- **Fine-Grained Control**: You can specify the duration and permissions for each valet key.

- **Security**: Limits exposure by restricting access to a specific resource for a limited time.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Potential for Misuse**: If the valet key is intercepted, unauthorized access may occur within the time window and permissions set.

- **Complexity**: Implementing this pattern securely requires careful attention to detail.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Signed URLs**: Similar to Valet Keys but generally for HTTP resources.

- **OAuth Scopes**: More comprehensive but often heavier on the service.
