# Data Encryption at Rest Pattern


## 1. Context

Storing sensitive data in a distributed or cloud environment poses the risk of unauthorized access, either by insiders or through a data breach. Traditional access control mechanisms may not suffice to adequately protect this data.


## 2. Problem

How can you ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data stored in databases, file systems, or object storage, particularly in a cloud or distributed setting?


## 3. Solution

The Data Encryption at Rest Pattern involves encrypting data before it's stored on disk. Keys used for encryption should be securely managed, often using a Key Management Service (KMS). The pattern also typically involves:

- **Key Rotation**: Periodic rotation of encryption keys.

- **Access Controls**: Limit who can decrypt the data.

- **Auditing and Monitoring**: Track who accessed or modified the data.


## 4. Benefits

- **Confidentiality**: Unauthorized users cannot decipher the encrypted data without access to the encryption keys.

- **Compliance**: Helps in meeting regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

- **Data Integrity**: Encrypted data is harder to tamper with.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Performance Overhead**: Encryption and decryption processes can introduce latency and consume more CPU resources.

- **Complexity**: Key management and rotation add complexity to data storage and access mechanisms.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Tokenization**: Replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens. Useful in certain contexts but doesn't provide the same level of security as encryption.

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Using ACLs to restrict access to data. This controls who can access the data but doesn't protect against data breaches effectively.
