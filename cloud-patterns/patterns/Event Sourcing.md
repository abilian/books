# Event Sourcing Pattern


## 1. Context

In complex systems, particularly those involving distributed microservices, understanding the state of the system at any given time can be challenging. Traditional CRUD operations overwrite the state, making it difficult to reconstruct past states or understand the sequence of state changes.


## 2. Problem

When multiple services interact and modify data, keeping a consistent state can be complicated. Overwritten data in CRUD operations means losing historical state, making it hard to debug issues, trace transactions, or implement features like undo functionality.


## 3. Solution

The Event Sourcing pattern captures all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events. These events are stored in the order they occur in an event store. The current state can be reconstructed by replaying these events. This pattern is often combined with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to separate the read and write operations for a service.


## 4. Benefits

- **Audit Trail**: Offers an excellent way to trace back all operations affecting the state.

- **Debugging**: Simplifies debugging by replaying events to recreate issues.

- **Temporal Query**: Makes it possible to query the state of the system at any point in time.

- **Scalability**: By using CQRS alongside Event Sourcing, you can scale read and write workloads independently.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Managing, storing, and replaying events can add complexity to the system.

- **Event Volume**: The event store can grow large quickly, raising issues of storage and management.

- **Schema Evolution**: Changes in the schema of the events can be difficult to manage.

- **Consistency**: Achieving strong consistency between the event store and the reconstructed state can be challenging.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Snapshotting**: Periodically storing the state to avoid replaying a long chain of events. However, this partially negates the benefit of having a full history.

- **Traditional Databases**: Use traditional RDBMS for simpler needs, but this sacrifices some of the advanced capabilities like temporal queries.
