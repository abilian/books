# Operational Transformation Pattern


## 1. Context

Real-time collaborative applications, such as document editors or collaborative coding environments, require multiple users to apply changes concurrently to a shared data structure. In such contexts, traditional locking or versioning mechanisms are impractical as they can severely limit the responsiveness and fluidity of the collaboration. The Operational Transformation Pattern is often used in scenarios where low-latency, real-time collaboration is a necessity.


## 2. Problem

When multiple users are concurrently updating a shared data structure, conflicts can easily arise, leading to inconsistency and divergence. These conflicts become particularly challenging in distributed systems where network latency and partial failures are factors. How can you enable multiple users to collaborate in real-time while ensuring that all users converge to a consistent state?


## 3. Solution

Operational Transformation (OT) is a technique that transforms operations in such a way that they can be applied in any order but still achieve a consistent state. When an operation is performed on a shared data structure, the operation is not immediately applied. Instead, it is transformed with respect to any concurrent operations that have occurred. This transformed operation is then applied, ensuring that all instances reach the same final state despite operations being applied in different orders.


## 4. Benefits

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Enables multiple users to work together in a seamless, real-time manner.

- **Strong Convergence**: Ensures that all replicas of the shared data structure converge to the same state, even when changes are made concurrently.

- **Low Latency**: Because operations can be applied locally first and then synchronized, the pattern can provide a low-latency user experience.

- **Simplicity for End-Users**: Users don't have to deal with merge conflicts manually, as the system takes care of resolving them.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: The algorithms for operational transformation can be complex to implement and reason about, particularly for more complex types of operations or data structures.

- **Ordering Challenges**: While OT handles concurrent operations, ensuring the correct causal ordering of operations can still be a challenge and might require additional mechanisms like vector clocks.

- **Scalability**: As the number of users and operations increases, the computational and network overhead for transforming and disseminating operations can become a limiting factor.

- **Error Sensitivity**: Errors in the implementation or in network communication can lead to inconsistency, which might be difficult to recover from.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **[Conflict-free Replicated Data Types ()**: These are data structures designed to allow multiple replicas to be updated independently and concurrently, with a mechanism to merge updates into a consistent state.

- **[Pessimistic Locking](./Pessimistic%20Locking.md)**: While impractical for many real-time collaborative applications due to its impact on responsiveness, it can be suitable for less time-sensitive applications.

- **Snapshots and Merging**: Take periodic snapshots of the shared data structure and resolve conflicts through merging. This is simpler but can lead to a less fluid user experience.
