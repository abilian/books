# Serverless (Function as a Service) Pattern


## 1. Context

Serverless computing is particularly relevant when you have unpredictable workloads, stateless applications, or event-driven architectures. In these scenarios, the overhead of managing servers can be a distraction from the core business logic.


## 2. Problem

How can you focus more on building application functionality and less on the infrastructure management while optimizing resource utilization?


## 3. Solution

The Serverless Pattern, or Function as a Service (FaaS), allows you to decompose your application into small, stateless functions. These functions are event-driven and only consume resources when they are active, automatically scaling based on the number of incoming events.


## 4. Benefits

- **Cost-Efficient**: You only pay for the compute time you consume.

- **Developer Productivity**: Developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

- **Auto-Scaling**: Scales automatically with the number of incoming events.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Cold Starts**: The time it takes to initialize a function can introduce latency.

- **Limited Customization**: You are constrained by the capabilities and limitations of the serverless platform.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Containerization**: Using container orchestration services like Kubernetes for more control over your environment.

- **Microservices**: For stateful applications or complex coordination, a microservices approach may be more appropriate.
