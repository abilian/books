# Decomposition Pattern


## 1. Context

Organizations with large monolithic applications often face scalability, manageability, and agility challenges. This is especially evident when there's a need to move to cloud-native architectures or when the organization wants to adopt DevOps practices. The Decomposition Pattern is commonly used to transition from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture.


## 2. Problem

Monolithic architectures become increasingly difficult to manage, scale, and update as they grow. Modifying a single component requires redeploying the entire application, which increases the risk and complexity of making changes. Additionally, the architecture often becomes a bottleneck for adopting new technologies or scaling specific components independently. How can we make this architecture more modular, scalable, and manageable?


## 3. Solution

Decompose the monolithic application into a set of loosely coupled microservices. Each microservice should ideally represent a single business capability and should be independently deployable and scalable. This decomposition is generally guided by principles like domain-driven design to ensure that each microservice aligns with a specific business function or process.


## 4. Benefits

- **Scalability**: Each microservice can be scaled independently, allowing for more efficient resource utilization.

- **Agility**: Enables faster development cycles and the ability to update or add new features more rapidly.

- **Technological Freedom**: Microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled using different technologies that best fit their requirements.

- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service have limited impact on the availability and functionality of other services.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: The shift from a monolithic to a microservices architecture introduces complexities like inter-service communication, data consistency, and service discovery.

- **Data Management**: Decomposing a monolith often involves breaking down a unified database into databases that are specific to each service, requiring strategies for data consistency and integrity.

- **Operational Overhead**: Requires more sophisticated operational tools and practices for deployment, monitoring, and logging, adding to operational complexity.

- **Migration Cost**: The process of decomposing a monolith can be resource-intensive, requiring careful planning, coordination, and testing.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **[Modular Monolith](./Modular Monolith.md)**: Instead of fully decomposing into microservices, keep a monolithic architecture but make it modular for easier management and partial scaling.

- **Serverless Functions**: For certain use-cases, breaking down functionalities into serverless functions may offer some of the advantages of decomposition without the overhead of managing microservices.
