# Anti-Corruption Layer Pattern


## 1. Context

When integrating multiple subsystems that have different domain models or semantics, there's a risk that changes in one model may negatively impact another, leading to what's known as "model corruption."


## 2. Problem

How can you safely integrate different subsystems that have their own bounded contexts and domain models without one corrupting the other?


## 3. Solution

Implement an Anti-Corruption Layer that serves as a facade or adapter between the different subsystems. This layer translates requests between the differing models, ensuring that they remain decoupled and that changes in one model don't corrupt another.


## 4. Benefits

- **Isolation**: Protects domain models from influence by foreign models.

- **Decoupling**: Allows for subsystems to evolve independently.

- **Simplified Integration**: Makes it easier to integrate disparate systems without deep changes to their internal models.


## 5. Drawbacks

- **Additional Complexity**: Introduces an extra layer and translation logic.

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires upkeep as domain models evolve.


## 6. Alternative Solutions

- **Data Transformation Services**: A separate service can be used to transform data, but it may not provide real-time translation.

- **Shared Kernel**: Sharing a subset of the domain model between services, although this couples the services to some extent.
